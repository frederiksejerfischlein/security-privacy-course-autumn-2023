Q1 - Mention something that the group did well

You nicely introduced and explained the chi-squared test with examples, as well as why it’s good in your case.

All answers to the analysis questions exhaust the topic: they explain what and how is being tested, the methodology (including chosen significance level), the results and what they mean.

Good removal of columns. Stripping citizenship is also a good idea because in this dataset it’s heavily skewed on Denmark, so would provide less quality data.

Q2 - Mention something that the group could improve at

There were no glaring issues spotted, only possible suggestions:

You explain that you are testing the hypothesis of association, and provide the threshold for the p-value in Question C, but use it first in A. Perhaps the explanation could be moved to question A.

Another good anonymization method which could be used is L-diversity, which handles some of the weaknesses of k-anonymity. The chosen party would then be the sensitive variable.

Q3 - Describe the techniques you used to disclose the preferences of voters in the dataset

Grouped the values based on the available quasi-identifiers in the public data, found the groups that voted all for
the same party. Matched those groups to the people in them. 

Q4 - For how many voters did you succeed in disclosing their political preferences?

37


Q5 - Provide the list of voters in the dataset whose preferences you managed to disclose, together with the disclosed preferences (e.g. "Jane Smith, red")
